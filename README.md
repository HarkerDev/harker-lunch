# harker-lunch :fries::curry::rice::meat_on_bone::hamburger::spaghetti::sushi::fried_shrimp:

A simple web application for Harker students to check what's for lunch.

## Usage

Go to [the Github IO page](http://aggarwalneeraj141.github.io/harker-lunch/) to access the schedule, or [tiny.cc/lunchmenu](tiny.cc/lunchmenu).

## Features

- Bootstrap tables for easy formatting and control
- Automatically hides previous days in the week

## Key

In the provided menu by Harker, certain dishes are marked to be vegetarian, gluten-free, or both.

We display this information to the user by coloring table cells for dishes. The bootstrap default classes `.success`, `.info`, and `.active` are used to provide a simple color key for the user to identify the dishes respectively.
